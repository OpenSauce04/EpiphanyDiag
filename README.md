# EpiphanyDiag
An open source diagnostic tool for The Binding of Isaac: Epiphany

When run, it generates a file called `EpiphanyDiagnostics.tar.gz`, which contains a mod list as well as every log file Repentance has ever generated

This program should not be run outside of the Epiphany folder, as it will generate an incorrect mod list
